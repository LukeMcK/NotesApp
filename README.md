# NotesApp

The following project was built while working through the FullStackOpen [https://fullstackopen.com/en/] curriculum with aid from the curriculum.

Tech Stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js

This is meant to simulate a notepad. Currently it is hooked up to a MongoDB database that I have set up at the following site: https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database. There are not currently any filters being used for moderation.
I may add these later if the public access to this project online proves to be a bad move, or I may just take it down.
You are able to Create a note, refresh the page to Read from the database, Update existing notes (Important/Not Important), and the Delete functionality is implemented on the backend however it has not yet been hooked up to the frontend.

It can be found online here: https://render-test-1lml.onrender.com/
